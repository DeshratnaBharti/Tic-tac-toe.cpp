# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++

This is a simple 2-player console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++. Players take turns placing their markers on a 3x3 board until one wins or the game ends in a tie.

## 🧠 Features

- Two-player mode
- Input validation (only accepts numbers 1–9)
- Prevents placing a marker on an already occupied slot
- Checks for all win conditions (rows, columns, diagonals)
- Declares a winner or a tie
- Board updates after every move

## 🛠️ How to Compile and Run

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (like `g++`).

### Compile:
```bash
g++ -o tic_tac_toe.cpp
